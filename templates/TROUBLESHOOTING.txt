CHROME AND CHROMEDRIVER
-----------------------

Please ensure that the chromedriver version matches that of the installed Chrome version.
In case of version mismatch errors, you can download the appropriate chromedriver version from:

    https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

And place it under the 'chromedriver' directory, replacing the bundled one.

DEBUGGING
---------

Please check the log-files under the 'system/logs/' directories for errors or
information that could explain whatever unwanted behavior you may be experiencing.

Web Interface
-------------

Logs about the operation of the web interface can be found under 'system/logs/webui/'.

Scan/Instance/Dispatcher
------------------------

If you are experiencing problems for a given scan and you'd like to gain more
information about its operation you can get debugging information by:

* Starting a Dispatcher with: bin/arachni_rpcd --reroute-to-logfile --debug
* Adding that Dispatcher to the web interface (default address is 'localhost:7331').
* Performing a scan using that Dispatcher.

Detailed operational information about the Instances provided by that Dispatcher
(and their scans) will be available in log-files under 'system/logs/framework/'.
(Each Dispatcher and each Instance get their own log-file.)

KNOWN ERRORS
------------

Database errors/crashes
-------------------------

The web interface uses, by default, an SQLite3 database to allow a configuration-free
out of the box experience, however, this setup is not suitable for larger workloads.

In order to be able to manage a large number of Scans and/or Dispatchers, you'll
have to configure the interface to use a PostgreSQL database by following the
instructions outlined in this Wiki page:
